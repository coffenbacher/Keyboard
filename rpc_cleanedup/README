****************  USING REMTOP  ****************

*************************************************

This program is intended to work like a remote desktop.  It  will allow you
to control the mouse and keyboard of remote computers and be able to switch
between multiple remote computers and the local computer itself.  In addition,
whenever connected to a remote computer, you will also receive screenshots of
the other computer.

***********************************************
****STARTING THE SERVICE ON THE REMOTE SIDE****
***********************************************
All remote computers to which the local computer will want to connect must
    start the remtop service:
$ ./remtop_svc &

*********************************************
****RUNNING THE PROGRAM ON THE LOCAL SIDE****
*********************************************
The local computer needs to then run the remtop executable and provide all
the host names/IP addresses that it wants to connect to as command line 
arguments.  All of these MUST be valid hosts running the service.
Here is an example:
$ ./remtop 10.42.52.43 charlie-laptop 10.54.42.52

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~SWITCHING HOSTS~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program will start by allowing the local computer to control the mouse and
keyboard of the first host specified.  The user can use the Ctrl-Shift-Up
key combination to switch to the next host and the Ctrl-Shift-Down key
combination to switch to the previous host. 

The Ctrl-Shift-l key can be used to switch to the local host and regain
control over one's own computer.  A valid local host address may also be
specified as a command line argument with the rest of the host names.  
Use Ctrl-Shift-Up and Ctrl-Shift-Down to go back to switching between the
hosts specified in the command line argument.  

~~~~~~~~~~~
~~QUITING~~
~~~~~~~~~~~
To quit the program at any time, use the Ctrl-Alt-q key combination.
